Here you can find the code I quickly developped just to try my first Kaggle Competition!

Given a train file, Titanic competition is about predicting who survived and who didn't. 

Train file : 
      	  
	  Row : A person
	  
	  Column : survived (yes, not), age, sex, class (1st, 2nd, 3rd), fare, #Siblings+(SpouseHusband) etc..

Test File : same as Train File but without the answer (Survived) of course. (Yet , it is quite the same as you can see the names of people and thus check on internet if they survived or not)

I finished with a 0.78% accuracy. The figure kaggle_titanic.png shows you how well this code performed on the test file (with no cheating of course). It shows also how much this code can be improved.
